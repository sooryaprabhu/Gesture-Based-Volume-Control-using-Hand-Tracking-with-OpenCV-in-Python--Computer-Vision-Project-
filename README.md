# Gesture-Based-Volume-Control-using-Hand-Tracking-with-OpenCV-in-Python--Computer-Vision-Project-
This project implements a gesture-based volume control system using hand tracking techniques with OpenCV in Python. By leveraging computer vision algorithms, the system tracks the user's hand movements through a webcam feed and interprets specific gestures to adjust the system volume accordingly.
